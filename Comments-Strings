getMax and getMin work great.
getMaxIndex and getMinIndex have some problems, however! You update the index, but not the maximum or minimum values.
As a result, your methods return the last item that is greater than (or less than) the first item in the array.

Try it out with a variety of different sets of input, like {"Leah", "Zebra", "Marks"} ...

Right now: 8/10.  9/10 when finished.

Update Feb.1 : Looks like you updated the file, but maybe you uploaded an earlier version.
  It still works the same as before (you don't update maximum/minimum, so you're not searching properly)
